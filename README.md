## 🚀 Overview

**Matrix** is an enterprise-grade, AI-powered autonomous security testing platform that democratizes penetration testing through intelligent agent orchestration. Built with **Groq AI** (Llama 3.3 70B) and a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, Matrix simulates real-world attacker behavior to discover vulnerabilities before they're exploited.

### Why Matrix?

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 8 Specialized Security Agents

Each agent is purpose-built for specific attack vectors, powered by AI analysis and exploitability gates:

| Agent | Attack Vectors | Detection Methods | Example Findings |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Error-based, Blind, Time-based | AI-powered pattern matching, Database error analysis | Union-based extraction, Boolean blind SQLi |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Reflected, Stored, DOM-based | Payload reflection detection, Context analysis | Script injection, Event handler XSS |
| **CSRF** | Token bypass, SameSite analysis | Form submission analysis, Cookie inspection | Missing CSRF tokens, Weak SameSite policies |
| **SSRF** | Internal IP access, Cloud metadata | URL parameter testing, Response analysis | AWS metadata access, Internal network probing |
| **Command Injection** | OS command execution, Path traversal | Shell metacharacter testing, Output analysis | Remote code execution, File system access |
| **Authentication** | Brute force, Session hijacking | Login flow analysis, Session token testing | Weak passwords, Session fixation |
| **API Security** | IDOR, Mass assignment, Rate limiting | Endpoint enumeration, Parameter fuzzing | Broken object-level authorization, Data exposure |
| **GitHub Security** | Secret scanning, Dependency analysis | Repository analysis, Code pattern matching | Hardcoded credentials, Vulnerable dependencies |

### 🎯 Advanced Capabilities

## 📊 Evaluation & Benchmarks

Matrix's detection capabilities are validated against intentionally vulnerable applications:

- **OWASP Juice Shop**: E-commerce web application
- **DVWA**: Damn Vulnerable Web Application
- **Acunetix VulnWeb**: SQL injection and XSS testbed

Performance metrics (agent-specific confidence scores and detection rates) are continuously tracked. Run the evaluation suite:

```bash
cd backend
python evaluate_scanner.py
cat benchmark_results.json
```

See the [Documentation](http://localhost:3000/docs) page for ROC curves, precision/recall metrics, and validation methodology.

## 🔒 Security & Ethics

### Responsible Use

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This tool is for **authorized security testing only**. Always obtain proper written permission before scanning any target. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

### WAF Evasion Disclaimer

WAF evasion techniques are **disabled by default** and require explicit user consent via a warning modal. These features are intended solely for:

- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research with permission
- Red team exercises in controlled environments

Misuse of these capabilities may violate computer fraud laws (CFAA, GDPR, etc.). Users are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws.
